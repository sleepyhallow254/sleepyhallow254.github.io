### Steps to Make a Commit in Git

1. Check the current status with `git status`
2. Stage your changes using `git add <filename>` or `git add .`
3. Create a commit with a descriptive message using `git commit -m "message"`

## Exercise 7 — Code Block

Here's a simple Python function that calculates the factorial of a number:

````python

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
